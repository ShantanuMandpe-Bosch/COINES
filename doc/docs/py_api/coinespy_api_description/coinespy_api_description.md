# coinespy API description

As coinespy is only a wrapper on top of coinesAPI, the following API documentation is limited
to the wrapper only. Details about meaning of variables and functionality can be found in the
corresponding coinesAPI documentation in the chapter above. The following function calls are defined within the class coinesBoard. Thus in order to access the functions, the user has to
create an object of that class first.

```python
import coinespy as cpy
coinesboard = cpy.CoinesBoard()
```
